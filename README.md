# ags4-starter
Minimal reproducible AGS data validation and exploration toolkit for geotechnical engineers.

AGS4 is the industry standard format for geotechnical and geoenvironmental data exchange in the UK and internationally. Using Python and the python-ags4 library, you can read, convert, validate, and export AGS4 files, allowing you to automate repetitive data handling tasks and replace manual spreadsheet workflows with reproducible scripts.  ￼
